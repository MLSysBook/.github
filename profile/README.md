# 📘 Machine Learning Systems: Textbook and Educational Resources

Welcome to the official GitHub organization for the **Machine Learning Systems** textbook — an open-access, system-first initiative to train a new generation of engineers who think holistically across algorithms, data, hardware, and infrastructure. This organization is part of a long-term vision to shape the future of ML systems education — both in academia and in practice.
